Premade Party Adder (for IWD2)
Github: https://github.com/D2-mods/Premade-Party-Adder-for-IWD2
Installs on: Icewind Dale 2


==================================================
Overview
==================================================
Adds up to 5 premade parties to the party selection screen, including character info and customizable desciptions. 
There's also an option to remove the existing parties.

NOTE: Currently, the party info will only show unmodded Skill/Feat names.


==================================================
Installation
==================================================
- Place up to 6 CHR files in one of the party folders
- Run the installer
- Each party is a separate component and CHR files are added to the Characters folder
	
Optional: 
- Biographies will also be copied to the Characters folder (must be same filename). These are just text files with the .RES extension. Characters without a RES file will instead get the generic biography used for Black Pits 2, with the addition of their name.
- Portraits in the folder will be copied to the override (though not made selectable at character creation).


==================================================
Customizable descriptions
==================================================
- You can edit the party name and description text by editing the "customize" files in each party folder. IWD2 uses two descriptions, one above and one below the character stats. Each description must be a single line or paragraph without breaks, but they can be as long or short as you want.
- I also included some basic starter info as default text if you choose not to customize the desciptions.


==================================================
Additional info
==================================================
- Characters are added in number/alphabetical order. If there are more than 6 CHR files in the folder, only the first 6 are added to the party, though all will be copied to the Characters folder and can be imported.
